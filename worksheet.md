# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide?  Which is better?

  Git provides a Distributerd system , this is better because its faster , if you make changes to a file , that file will be on your computer and the change is made.
  -fast
  -open source and free
  -offline access etc.

  But with BitBucket , since its a centralized system . everytime you make a change on a file you have to access a server


  * Who made the last commit to repository A? Matthew Roberts made the last commit on 2022-08-18

  * Who made the first commit to repository A? The first commit was made by Jon Mountjoy on  2014-08-11

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B? DavePearce made both the first and last commit.

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

  For file *(B) the most file with most activity is the modules file. how ?
  using this command git rev-list --objects --all | awk '$2' 
| sort -k2 | uniq -cf1 | sort -rn | head

i was able to sort from the most commited file to the least. module had the most commits of 3123.


for the File *(A) the file with the most activity is templates with 34 commits.
# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
